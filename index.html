        Previously I have also worked with Android development (Java) and PHP-based web development, and have also used a number of other languages and frameworks for prototyping or personal projects, including Vue.js, Ionic &amp; Xamarin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am continually looking out for and trying out new technologies, following development newsletters and taking online courses, and have set myself the target to learn a new programming language or framework each quarter.

        <p>A prototype created in order to test the feasibility of using Ionic and Angular to produce a cross-platform version of the MyPeaks iOS application mentioned above. As this is a prototype not all functionality may be implemented or work as expected.</p>
        <p>Ultimately I have decided that whilst this is feasible, the native map experience and performance on the iOS platform is superior to the web app alternative, so am sticking to the native application for the time being.</p>
